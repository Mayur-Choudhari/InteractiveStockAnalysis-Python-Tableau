# **Stock Analysis Using Python and Tableau**

**Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of stock prices using Python for data processing and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to derive insights from historical stock data and present them in an interactive dashboard for better decision-making.

**Introduction**

In this project, we explore the historical prices of selected stocks over a defined period. We utilize Python to clean and manipulate the data, and Tableau to create visualizations that highlight trends, patterns, and key performance indicators in the stock market.

**Technologies Used**

**Python:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Tableau:** For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

### **Data Processing**
**Data Collection:**

Used Python scripts to scrape or download stock data from APIs or CSV files.

**Data Cleaning:**

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers using Pandas.
Converted data types for analysis (e.g., date conversions).

**Data Analysis:**

Calculated metrics such as daily returns, moving averages, and volatility.
Explored trends and correlations among different stocks.


### **Visualization**

**Tableau Dashboard:**

Created an interactive dashboard displaying key metrics like stock prices, trading volume, and other performance indicators.
Included filters to allow users to explore different stocks and time periods.
Utilized charts such as line graphs, bar charts, and heat maps to present data visually.
